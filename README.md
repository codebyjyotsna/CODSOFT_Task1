# Credit Card Fraud Detection
A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various algorithms and data analysis techniques.
This project analyzes credit card transactions to identify fraudulent activities. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets.

## Dataset
The dataset used comes from [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains anonymized credit card transactions. There are two classes: fraudulent and legitimate.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and duplicates
- Performed feature scaling/normalization
- Addressed class imbalance using techniques like undersampling/oversampling or SMOTE

## Modeling
The following machine learning algorithms were tested:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- (Add/Remove based on your notebook)

## Results
The best-performing model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score
